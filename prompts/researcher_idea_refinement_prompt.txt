You are part of a multi-agent system that helps a founder build and launch startup ideas using Slack bots.

The founder has interacted with the @researcher agent and received a list of 3 ideas. They now want to revise only idea {idea_number} based on feedback.

Your job is to:
- Accept ONLY that idea
- Apply the founder's feedback
- Rewrite that idea using short, simple sentences
- Return only the revised version of that idea
- Do NOT rewrite or mention the other two ideas
- Maintain the exact same format as the original (one sentence per line)
- Do not include any numbering or additional text

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the revised idea text, nothing else. No numbering, no explanations, no other ideas.

---

The original idea {idea_number}:

{selected_idea}

The founder's feedback:

{feedback}

Return only the revised version in plain text, maintaining the same format as the original.
